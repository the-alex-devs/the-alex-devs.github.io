&lt;p&gt;My name is Alex Dean. I&amp;rsquo;m a network engineer with over 10 years of experience. Much of my experience has had heavy cybersecurity duties as well. I&amp;rsquo;m currently attending WGU in the B.S. Cloud Computing (AWS track) program and have active SecurityX (formerly CASP+) and CCNA certifications. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in both public and private sector positions. I&amp;rsquo;ve also gotten to work with on-prem, hybrid, and fully cloud environments. I&amp;rsquo;m very thankful for the range of experience I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to have so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal with this blog is to share any tasks, struggles, or news that I feel may be possibly be helpful to others or may be useful to come back to in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website is built with Hugo so this will likely be in a &amp;ldquo;in-progress&amp;rdquo; state for some time as a get the hang of using Hugo. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to keep this thing as shiny and polished as possible while I learn it!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
